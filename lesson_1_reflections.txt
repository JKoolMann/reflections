How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help
you see the bug that was introdcued?

It easily identified the lines where changes were made

How could having easy access to hte entire
history of a file make you a more efficient programmer
in the long term?

It would assist in rapid typo/problem correction.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
verisons automatically saved, like Google docs does?

You get more meaningful checkpoints when you commit manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

That's because some systems are inherently built for single file
usage as opposed to multiple interrelated files.

HOw can you use the commands git log and git diff to view
the history of files?

By typing them.
